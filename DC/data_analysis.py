PLOT INSTRUCTIONS

# plot 1: Transfer Characteristic I_D vs V_G (linear linear, log linear) 
        -> find mobility
        -> find V_t
        -> find S
        -> find V_on
        -> find I_on/I_off 

# plot 2: Output characteristics I_D vs V_D 
        -> see general behaviour

# plot 3: [use the semilog from plot 1]
        -> find S

# plot 4: Sqrt(I_D) vs V_G
        -> alternative for finding V_t
